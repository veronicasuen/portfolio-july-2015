                    <h3 class="clear-float">Project Outline</h3>
                    <p>Drawsaurus is a fun mobile game similar to broken telephone that uses both drawings and words. Users have to draw out a written prompt or describe an illustrated prompt created by a different player. </p> 

                    <h3 class="clear-float">Planning</h3>
                    <p>I came across this idea in a discussion with a friend of mine. At the time he was just beginning to program this awesome game with another friend. I needed another project for my Bloc.io course and he had no real user experience design for it yet, so I offered to do the design work for him.</p> 
                    
                    <p>My friend agreed and we started discussing the details. I had numerous questions: What were his goals with the game? How does he envision the end product? What kind of functionalities will it have? My conversation led me to a lot of useful answers, in addition to some productive back and forth on many aspects of the app. </p>

                    <p>Based on his answers and consideration of the game's rules, I began planning user stories and defining key actions. Some of these user stories included: </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>I want to join or start a game</li>
                        <li>I need to draw a picture based on the sentence I was given</li>
                        <li>I want to see the results of a finished game</li>
                    </ul>

                    </div>

                    <h3 class="clear-float">User Flows</h3>
                    <p>Even though this game seems simple at its core, it is the user stories and the little extra features that add to the experience that make it a bit more complex. These are the five major processes I created user flows for:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Joining/Starting a Game</li>
                        <li>Joining a Game Via Invitation</li>
                        <li>Playing a Turn</li>
                        <li>Viewing a Finished Game</li>
                        <li>Creating an Account</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The first and second processes sound similar at first, but the actions the user takes to join a game are different; hence why they were separated into different flows.</p>

                    <h3 class="clear-float">Branding</h3>
                    <p>I was initially provided with two things: a name, "Drawsaurus", and a sketch of a little dinosaur mascot holding a pencil. Drawsaurus is supposed to be a fun and casual game, so I chose to use bright colours and handwriting-like type to represent that aspect. Following the theming of drawing and doodling, I came up with two different concepts based on the assets given. </p>

                    <p>After conducting a short survey to find out which concept more people liked, I decided to go ahead with the one with the more sketch-like theming. </p>

                    <div class="post-images">
                        <img class="one-half one-whole-xs img-responsive" src="../img/drawsaurus_branding_01.png">
                        <img class="one-half one-whole-xs img-responsive" src="../img/drawsaurus_branding_02.png">
                    </div>


                    <h3 class="clear-float">Wireframes & Mockups</h3>
                    <p>I chose to create this app in a landscape format. Since the user will be drawing half the time, a landscape format allows them ample space to doodle, no matter what screen size they are using. For example, portrait and landscape may not make too much of a difference on an iPad due to the physical size of the screen, but older models of the iPhone, such as the 4 or 5, have much narrower widths in portrait mode. It may be awkward or difficult for some users to draw accurately in a constrained space.</p>

                    <p>The wireframes made for Drawsaurus were straight forward as the app as a whole is not very complex. While this was great for clearly communicating what needed to be on each screen, I found it difficult to create visually interesting mockups at first. Fortunately, the direction I set out in the branding through the typefaces, colours, and recurring visual elements contributed greatly to the personality of the app.</p>

                    <h3 class="clear-float">Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>While there are additional things to consider, such as game rules, I found that designing the user experience for games was not too different from designing for any other app. Many of the same processes, like creating user stories and working out the user flows, still had to be done. It was a great experience and I had a lot of fun figuring out how to design the app around the game's set parameters in addition to the limitations set out by my friend.</p>
