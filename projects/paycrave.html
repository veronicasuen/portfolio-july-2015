                    <h3 class="clear-float">Project Outline</h3>
                    <p>Paycrave is a mobile app that helps people find food trucks nearby to order from. Users can search, view menus, and pay for their order all from one convenient place. </p> 
                    <h3 class="clear-float">Planning</h3>
                    <p>The main goal of a food-finding app is to help get people fed, and there are many steps in between to accomplish that. I started by defining a few overarching key actions that users may take, which helped in determining what functions the app needs to have in order to fulfill those user stories.</p> 
                    <p>
                    For Paycrave, these stories centered around finding a food truck and making a purchase. Here are some examples:

                        <ul>
                            <li>I want to look for food trucks near me</li>
                            <li>I want to order and pay for food from this food truck</li>
                            <li>I want to leave a review for a food truck I've ordered from before</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <div class="post-images">
                        <a class="one-whole" href="../img/paycrave_planning.png"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="../img/paycrave_planning.png"></a>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="clear-float">User Flows</h3>
                    <p>I chose to present my user flows as specific processes based on the user stories created in the planning stages. 

                    In this app, there were five major processes:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Finding a Truck</li>
                        <li>Ordering / Purchasing Food</li>
                        <li>Viewing Past Purchases</li>
                        <li>Viewing and Submitting Reviews for a Truck</li>
                        <li>Creating an Account / Logging In</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="post-images">
                        <a class="one-half one-whole-xs" href="../img/paycrave_userFlows_01.jpg"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="../img/paycrave_userFlows_01.jpg"></a>
                        <a class="one-half one-whole-xs" href="../img/paycrave_userFlows_02.jpg"><img class="img-responsive center-block" src="../img/paycrave_userFlows_02.jpg"></a>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="clear-float">Branding</h3>
                    <p>As part of the Bloc.io program, Paycrave's general branding elements, including colours, typefaces, and logos, were provided. While I was given the choice to create my own branding, I thought this was a good opportunity to practice designing under certain restraints. </p>

                    <p>Based on the logo, "fun", "cute", and "simple" were some of the words I associated with the brand. The logo also inspired many rounded elements and chunkier-looking icons.</p>

                    <div class="post-images">
                        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="../img/paycrave_branding.png">
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="clear-float">Wireframes & Mockups</h3>
                    <p>This was my first time designing a mobile app so I had a lot to learn; I went through a couple iterations of design before the final mockups were created. Apple's iOS Human Interface Guidelines were a good starting point to familiarize myself with the process, but I quickly learned there are more things to consider, such as incorporating the branding into all the little aspects of the app rather than following the stock suggestions. </p>

                    <p>Using the user flows created earlier, I inferred what screens were needed and began making wireframes. The focus for Paycrave was on making it easy for a user to find a truck they're interested in purchasing from by providing relevant information and images upfront. Generally, people look for food when they are hungry, so the faster they're able to decide whether they like a food truck or not, the better.</p>

                    <h3 class="clear-float">Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p>Overall, I think this project was a good first try at designing for a mobile app. In addition, Paycrave was also a great exercise in learning how to design for a preset brand. </p>
